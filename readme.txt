Updates the WordPress post/page modified time when the output from a post/page shortcode or block changes.

== Description ==

WordPress updates the post/page modified time only when you save/update the post/page in the editor.

**If you have shortcodes or blocks that create dynamic content (ie. returning content from queries, files, feeds, etc.), the post/page modified time will not reflect these dynamic content changes.**

JSM's Accurate Modified Time for SEO plugin monitors the post/page content for changes and updates the post/page modified time as required.

If you use a social and search optimization plugin like WPSSO Core, Yoast SEO, The SEO Framework, etc., the Open Graph `og:updated_time` and `article:modified_time` meta tags, along with the Schema markup `dateModified` property, will show an accurate modification time if your post/page content changes.
